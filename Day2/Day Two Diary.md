# Day 2

## Part One

A pretty simple string splitting and managing exercise. The flexibility of Python's split function is really showing its value and I'm really wondering how I'll go about creating the same within Rust eventually. I'm also interested in the _twist_ for part two
_Simple enough solution, onto Part Two_

## Part Two

A little more interesting, but still seems like a minimum selection then continue kind of thing. I'm also thinking now about how I should split parts one and two up. I think I'm just gonna make a copy of Part One's function and tweak it for part two. Then I just decide which to call before running
_This was a good refactoring exercise for sure. Needs changed and a lot of code needed re-arranging, including execution scope_

## After completion

This one felt great. I remember seeing on the Subreddit that I guess odd numbered days have a reputation for their part two twist being brutal? Day 1 was quite the turn requiring some sliding window stuff (ish) but today's was pretty slight. Time for Day 3!
